# ObjectPicking
Object picking with Android OpenGL ES 2.0


~~Because I do not have Android phones, and Android emulator can not run the app, so there is no preview picture currently.~~

Go to the `Tools` -> `Android` -> `AVD Manager`, and change the settings of your device. 
Click the section `Emulated Performance` `Graphics` to `Software GLSE 2.0`.
